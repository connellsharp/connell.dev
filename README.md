# My Website

This repository hosts [my website](https://connell.dev).

It's built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The [/content](/content) folder contains markdown files that were originally copied over from [my old Jekyll blog](https://github.com/connellsharp/ConnellsBlog), so it this site works in the the same way.
