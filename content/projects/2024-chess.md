Play chess against the most common moves from lower rated players. But if you blunder, the game is over. If they blunder, you must take advantage of it, or the game is over. Keep practicing until you perfect your opening repertoire.

I used the [Lichess API](https://lichess.org/api), [stockfish.js](https://github.com/nmrugg/stockfish.js), [chessboardjs](https://chessboardjs.com/) and [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/).
