Plug in your midi keyboard and jam in key. This is to help learn diatonic piano scales. Navigate through the circle of fifths or through different modes and discover relationships between each key. Play along to common or randomly generated chord progressions in each key.

This has been quite fun to make. And I had to learn a fair bit of music theory just to express some of the types in TypeScript while building this.
