title: The Fear of Deploying
tags: agile ci-cd
---

"No deploy Fridays" can become a bit of a joke for some teams. Because, if we don't laugh, we'll cry. Behind this dark humour is a real fear of something going wrong, a fear of having to work late to fix an incident, or worse, a fear of being blamed for it.

A "code freeze" before a big event is another one. It's a sign that we're not confident enough to roll out new code without breaking something.

Agile development is about releasing early, getting feedback from the customer, and responding to change. A code freeze nips that in the bud. No releases, no feedback, no agility. **Releasing early** minimises the time spent building the wrong thing.

In fact, assuming developers are still building features during the freeze, just not releasing them, we end up bundling a whole bunch of changes ready to release once the freeze is thawed. A release with more changes has higher chance of going wrong, which increases the fear. It's a vicious cycle. **Small and frequent deployments** reduce the chance of deployments going wrong.

## Confidence

- Automated testing
- Monitoring
- Rollbacks
- Canary roll-outs
- Release channels

## Accepting Failure as Normal
