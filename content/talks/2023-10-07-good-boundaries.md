Deciding which things belong in which part of your system can make or break your architecture. To avoid creating a big ball of mud, we separate concerns and keep things organised. This talk takes us through different kinds of boundaries: What makes a good function? What makes a good class? A good service? We’ll discuss slicing vertically, building separate packages, and the trade-offs of splitting into many git repositories.

Then we’ll dive into the structure of a business problem domain. We’ll take tips from Domain-Driven Design about the types of subdomains we find, domain language, and how we can integrate between different Bounded Contexts.

Finally, we’ll look into the organisational structure of a company. We’ll look at Team Topologies, the types of teams, how they communicate, and how those human communication structures affect your architecture.

This visual presentation that brings these things together and aims to give you a different perspective on the structures we find.
