This is a story about how our team at Stack Overflow split out a small feature from a monolithic application into its own microservice. We moved the data to a new database, rebuilt the UI as a microfrontend using a new framework, and managed to deploy it without any downtime.

In this talk, weâ€™ll show how we used the Strangler Fig pattern and techniques from DDD to choose our domain. We'll dive into the challenges with Eventual Consistency, multi-tenancy, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and many more. You'll hear the choices we made, along with other options we considered, and what we learned from this experiment.
